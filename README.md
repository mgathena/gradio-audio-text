# nonstreaming.py

```
python nonstreaming.py
```

This is for non-streaming of text and audio. It works fine; audio can be heard and text is displayed 



# backend-fastrtc.py

```
python backend-fastrtc.py
```

This streams the audio; the agent is 'streaming' tokens to elevenlabs. But I can't see the text output. Only the AI's final response is to be heard and that part works fine.



# backend-fastrtc-all.py

```
python backend-fastrtc-all.py
```

My ultimate goal. I want to stream the AI's final response, but in the chatbot I want to display all the steps as well the final AI's response.
